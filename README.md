## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for my early front-end development project. This website was constructed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I developed this project in 2020 as part of my initial foray into front-end development. The primary purpose of maintaining this repository is to showcase the evolution of my coding skills. By comparing my earlier works with more recent projects, visitors can observe the progression and refinement of my development techniques.

### Motivation

I hope that by sharing my journey, others will be inspired to persevere in their learning paths. The progression evident in my projects serves as a testament to the fact that mastery requires dedication and hard work. I encourage everyone to embrace the challenges of learning, as the rewards are substantial and fulfilling.
