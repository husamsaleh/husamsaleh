## Introduction

Welcome to the git repository for one of my first websites, which also serves as my portfolio. This website was constructed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Project Background

I developed this project in 2020 as part of my initial foray into front-end development. It represents one of my earliest attempts at creating a fully functional website. The primary purpose of maintaining this repository is to showcase the evolution of my coding skills. By comparing my earlier works with more recent projects, visitors can observe the progression and refinement of my development techniques.

### Motivation

This portfolio website is a testament to my learning journey and dedication. I hope that by sharing my early experiences, others will be inspired to persevere in their learning paths. The progression evident in my projects serves as a testament to the fact that mastery requires dedication and hard work. I encourage everyone to embrace the challenges of learning, as the rewards are substantial and fulfilling.
